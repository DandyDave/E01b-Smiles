In this assignment/code I first adjusted the x and y coordinates in main1 until all of the shapes made a smiley face and that the face was centered.

In main 2 I set all of the objects which make up the face to x and y coordinates and then adjusted parts of the face using offsets.

In main 3 I did a similar thing to main 2 except that all other objects were set to thier own variables not just face.

In main 4 I made sure that the all the objects had the right coordinates as to make a repeating smiley face. Messing with lines 16 to 18 canged the spacing of the smileys and how many were drawn.
